  <h2>HONDA<i> CRF </i> 300 Rally</h2><br>
  <h2 id="hondah2">RIGHT!</h2>
    <p>I own the Honda CRF 300 Rally. It is reliable, has low maintenance, a bigger tank and is relatively cheap.</p>
    <p>Riding a light weight travel-enduro is for me the route off the paved road and into adventures like the
       <a href="https://transeurotrail.org/" hreflang="en">TET</a>,
       or an unplanned trip where i let my intuition surprise me, until i decide it is time to <bdo dir="rtl">turn back.</bdo></p>
    <p>Off the road, when you click on either one of these two posters, you can have a virtual tour in the HONDA museum 
      in Motegi, Japan !</p>

      <h3>HONDA CRF</h3>
      <p>The Honda CRF series is a line of four-stroke motocross, trail, and dual sport motorcycles manufactured and 
        marketed by Honda. The CRF line was launched in 2000 as a successor to the Honda CR series. The full sized motocross 
        bikes are equipped with liquid-cooled, single cylinder four-stroke engines that are available from 149 cc to 449 
        cc. The more trail friendly CRF's have simple air-cooled engines. They are considered among the best motorcross bikes 
        of their class, and have been a leading seller since their introduction.

      <h3>CRF250L/CRF300L</h3>
      <p>In April 2012, the completely redesigned dual-purpose CRF250L was launched in Japan. It shares a liquid-cooled 
        249 cc 4-stroke DOHC single-cylinder EFI engine with the CBR250R. It is manufactured in Thailand.
        The stroked-up CRF300L was introduced in November 2020.

      <h3>Rally version</h3>
      <p>The CRF 250 Rally and 300 Rally are the more travel oriented versions of the CRF 250L and 300L. The top 
        differentiators are the larger fuel tanks, more fairing and different headlights. 300 Rally tank is 5 litre 
        larger (12.8L vs 7.8L) and it has LED headlight integrated in a sizeable windshield, versus classic halogen bulb 
        on 300L and no windshield. It is only available in one color combination, the colors 
        of the <dfn><abbr>HRC</abbr></dfn> Honda Racing Team. This article has these colors.

      <h3>Fossil technology!</h3>
      <p>The engines in these bikes use an over-square design, which means that the diameter of the cylinder is larger than 
        the stroke of the piston. This allows for higher engine speeds and a reduction of reciprocating mass for a given 
        displacement. Another technology that is used is short piston skirts. The "skirt" area of the piston is the portion 
        on the side of the piston which comes into contact with the cylinder wall and aids piston stability. While the 
        introduction of the shorter skirt on the piston helps to reduce reciprocating mass, it also leads to more "rocking" 
        of the piston, or minute unwanted rotation of the piston around the axis of its wrist pin. This leads to more frequent 
        maintenance intervals for the pistons, piston rings, and cylinder walls.
