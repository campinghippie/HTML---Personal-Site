  <h2>RIGHT!</h2>
  <p>I love the honda CRF 300 Rally. It is reliable, has low maintenance intervals (every 10.000 km),
     a bigger tank and is relatively cheap.

      <h3>Honda CRF series</h3>
      <p>The Honda CRF series is a line of four-stroke motocross, trail, and dual sport motorcycles manufactured and 
        marketed by Honda. The CRF line was launched in 2000 as a successor to the Honda CR series. The full sized motocross 
        bikes are equipped with liquid-cooled, single cylinder four-stroke engines that are available from 149 cc to 449 
        cc. The more trail friendly CRF's have simple air-cooled engines. They are considered among the best motorcross bikes 
        of their class, and have been a leading seller since their introduction.

      <h3>Engine technology</h3>
      <p>The engines in these bikes use an over-square design, which means that the diameter of the cylinder is larger than 
        the stroke of the piston. This allows for higher engine speeds and a reduction of reciprocating mass for a given 
        displacement. Another technology that is used is short piston skirts. The "skirt" area of the piston is the portion 
        on the side of the piston which comes into contact with the cylinder wall and aids piston stability. While the 
        introduction of the shorter skirt on the piston helps to reduce reciprocating mass, it also leads to more "rocking" 
        of the piston, or minute unwanted rotation of the piston around the axis of its wrist pin. This leads to more frequent 
        maintenance intervals for the pistons, piston rings, and cylinder walls.

      <h3>CRF250L/CRF300L</h3>
      <p>In April 2012, the completely redesigned dual-purpose CRF250L was launched in Japan. It shares a liquid-cooled 
        249 cc 4-stroke DOHC single-cylinder EFI engine with the CBR250R. It is manufactured in Thailand.
        The stroked-up CRF300L was introduced in November 2020.

      <h3>CRF Rally</h3>
      <p>The CRF 250 Rally and 300 Rally are the more road oriented versions of the CRF 250L and 300L. The top 
        differentiators are the larger fuel tanks, more fairing and different headlights. 300 Rally tank is 5 litre 
        larger (12.8L vs 7.8L) and it has LED headlight integrated in a sizeable windshield, versus classic halogen bulb 
        on 300L and no windshield. It is only available in one color combination, the colors 
        of the <dfn><abbr>HRC</abbr></dfn> Honda Racing Team. This article has these colors.

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Although i have a full A-licence, riding a light weight travel-enduro is for me the route off the paved road and 
     into adventures like the
    <a href="https://transeurotrail.org/">TET</a>,
    or an unplanned trip where i let the route surprise me, following my intuition.
