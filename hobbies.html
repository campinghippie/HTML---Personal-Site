           <p><kbd>I used the HTML <code id="angular">&lt;<code>details</code>&gt;</code> tag here to create the yellow
             plate wich folds out, the <code id="angular">&lt;<code>summary</code>&gt;</code> tag to make the 
             visible & clickable bar, and the <code id="angular">&lt;<code>pre</code>&gt;</code> 
             tag to show preformatted text, used f.e. for poems, like in the <code id="angular">&lt;<code>footer</code>&gt;</code>
             of this page by a famous Dutch poet and playwright. 
             I used the <code id="angular">&lt;<code>code</code>&gt;</code> tags around the previous displayed HTML-tags to 
             define them as pieces of computer code to your browser, and had to use letter-combinations to display the 
             angular brackets on the screen, in order for the "IDE" not to interpret it as code. What i do here, explaining 
             some software problems, is called rubberducking. The name is a reference to a story in the book <q>The Pragmatic 
             Programmer</q> in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves 
             to explain it, line by line, to the duck. Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to 
             someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution 
             in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it 
             actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. More generally, teaching a subject forces 
             its evaluation from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding. By using an inanimate 
             object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to interrupt anyone else. I gave my
             duck away to my cousin Hugo and niece Sara but i promise you to ask it back, so that i will not use you 
             anymore as rubber duck...</kbd></p>
