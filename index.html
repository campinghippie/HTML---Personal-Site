        <p>Hello World, my goal is to become a good (robotic?)software-developer, in order to automate work for other people, enabling them to live a happier life and have more free time, <br>
          and to start a camping where i can live and work in peace.
          Camping Hippie (CH) is a moto-wildcamper right now, for the love of nature and adventure. In his dream-camping at the seaside, he will use desalinated water from the sea to create plantgrowth and shadow. Around the camping there will be an obstacle run-mountainbike-swimming triathlon course to get some movement in between coding and to atract the right type of sporty customers. On this challenging and original trial there will be several points where the sporter receives coolant in the form of a desalinated seawater-shower, induced by a motion-senor. Perhaps it will be a camping focussed on digital nomads. Robotic software skills will be used to automate as many camping employee's tasks as possible, barriers, bartenders, booking. To learn this, Campinghippie needs a strong 10 Commandments of Coding & Camping Conduct:
        <ol>  
          <li>Code, Camp, Code, Motorcycle, Code, Socialize, Code, Motorcycle Maintenance, Code, Reading Book, Code, Surf, Code, Paraglide, Code, Sleep, Repeat.</li>
          <li>Never allow doubt, negative emotion, follow your ratio; this is a good plan, because with fun is slow, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast, keeping coding Happy.</li>
          <li>Stay the f** out of conflict, struggle, stay in the (github) Flow!</li>
          <li>Start out with ROBOSHOP.COM, a website focussed on selling robotic parts.</li>
          <li>CH Doesn't focus on the goals mentioned above, the camping, the company, a lot of things are out of Hippies control. Instead, focus on the proces, little steps Camping Hippie makes to improve his income and software knowledge.</li>
          <li>CH will be proud on his transformation from inspiration to digitalisation, tuned out from his hallucinant fantasies dropping straight into the here and now, the right place and the right time, in TOTAL CONTROL and stress free.</li>
          <li>CH wil never be exploited or manipulated and will not exploit or manipulate other people, it gives him stress, and Hippie needs to avoid stress. Exploitation and manipulation is for resources and variables.</li>
          <li>Besides coding, no more screentime during the workweek. Netflix and News will be replaced by sport and other leisure activities.</li>
          <li>CH will keep the money roll'in.</li>
          <li>CH will give himself positive feedback on the end of the day</li>
        </ol>   
        As a result of following these commandments, Camping Hippie will be able to generate a constant flow of income to pump into the camping business while being present there</p>
