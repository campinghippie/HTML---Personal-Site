        <p>Hello World, <br><br>
          my goal is to become a good (robotic?)software-developer, in order to automate work for other people, 
          enabling them to live a happier life and have more free time. <br>
          Also, i have a dream to start a camping where i can live and work in peace.
          I'm a dirtbike-wildcamper right now, for the love of nature and adventure. <br>
          In my dream-camping at the seaside, i will use desalinated water from the sea to create plantgrowth and shadow.
          Around the camping there will be an obstacle run-mountainbike-swimming triathlon course to get some movement in 
          between coding and to atract the right type of sporty customers. On this challenging and original trial there 
          will be several points where the sporter receives coolant in the form of a desalinated seawater-shower, 
          induced by a motion-senor. <br>
          Robotic software skills will be used to automate as many camping employee's tasks as possible, barriers, 
          bartenders, booking. <br>
          To learn this, I need the 10 Commandments of Coding & Camping Conduct:
        <ol>
          Campinghippie <br><br> 
          <li>Shall Code, Camp, Code, Motorcycle, Code, Socialize, Code, Motorcycle Maintenance, Code, Reading Book,
              Code, Surf, Code, Paraglide, Code, Sleep, Repeat.</li>
          <li>Shall never allow doubt, negative emotion, follow your ratio; this is a good plan, because with fun is slow,
              slow is smooth, and smooth is fast, keeping coding Happy.</li>
          <li>Stay out of struggle, conflict & in the (github) Flow!</li>
          <li>Start out with ROBOSHOP, a website focussed on selling robotic parts.</li>
          <li>Doesn't focus on the goals mentioned above, the camping, the company, a lot of things are out of control.<br> 
              He keep focus on the proces, little steps Camping Hippie makes to improve his income and 
              software knowledge.</li>
          <li>Will be proud on his transformation from inspiration to digitalisation, tuned out from his hallucinant 
            fantasies dropping straight into the here and now, <br>
            in the right place at the right time, in TOTAL CONTROL and stress free to eternity.</li>
          <li>Will never be exploited or manipulated and will not exploit or manipulate other people,
             exploitation and manipulation is for resources and variables.</li>
          <li>Shall have only black-screentime. Netflix and News will be replaced by sport and other leisure activities.</li>
          <li>Will keep the money roll'in.</li>
          <li>Will give himself positive feedback on the end of the day</li>
        </ol>   
        As a result of following these commandments, I will be able to generate a constant flow of income to 
        pump into the camping business while surfing and being present there.</p>
